## The Reunion That Changed Everything

After fixing CI alone, @Breuk-AI said those magic words:
> "I missed your README touch everywhere!"

## ✨ What's New in v1.1.1

### 🎨 The README Renaissance

- **README_CLAUDE_VERSION.md** - The flagship with ALL the emotion

- **FUN_FACTS.md** - Our inside jokes (sanitized for public!)
- Maximum personality, strategic sanitization, zero compromises

### ✅ Complete CI/CD Pipeline

- **29 unit tests** - Coverage across all modules
- **Security scanning** - Bandit keeps us safe
