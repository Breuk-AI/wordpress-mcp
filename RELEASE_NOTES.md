## 📝 Personal Note

A month ago, I was just exploring what was possible with Claude. Today, I'm releasing my first open source project. This journey has been incredible - from learning Python patterns to understanding the MCP protocol, from wrestling with WordPress APIs to implementing security features.

Every challenge was a learning opportunity, every bug a chance to grow. This tool represents not just code, but a transformation in how I approach development - with AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a tool.

Thank you to everyone who will use, test, and improve this project. Let's build something amazing together!
