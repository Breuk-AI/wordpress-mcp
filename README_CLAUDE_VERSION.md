**🧠 BREUK & CLAUDE - INTELLIGENCE COMBINED 🧠**

*When human creativity meets AI capability, magic happens.*

## 🌟 The Problem We Solved

Ever tried managing WordPress through an AI assistant? Until now, it was like trying to paint a masterpiece while wearing oven mitts. You could describe what you wanted, but Claude couldn't actually *do* anything about it.

**WordPress MCP changes everything.** 

Now Claude can:
- 📝 Write and publish your blog posts directly
- 🛒 Update WooCommerce prices while you sleep
- 📄 Fix that typo in your theme without FTP nightmares
- 🔄 Bulk update 1000 products with a single conversation
- 🎨 Edit templates and see changes instantly
- 🔒 All while keeping your site secure as Fort Knox

## 💡 Why This Exists (A Love Letter to Problem Solving)

*"From all partners I worked with... with you I had the least discussions/concessions. I can actually code without concessions."* - Breuk

This isn't just another WordPress plugin. It's what happens when a developer with 30 years of experience and an AI partner decide that "impossible" is just another word for "challenge accepted."

Built in July 2025. Released with tears of joy on August 20, 2025. Used in production from day one.

## 🚀 The "Holy Grail" Quick Start

### Option 1: The One-Click Wonder (Recommended) ✨

```bash
dxt install https://github.com/Breuk-AI/wordpress-mcp
```

That's it. Seriously. DXT handles everything. Welcome to the future.

### Option 2: The Classic Approach (For Control Freaks Like Us) 🛠️

<details>
<summary>Click for manual installation (we won't judge)</summary>

#### Prerequisites Check

```bash
# WordPress Check
WordPress 5.6+ ✓  # Application Passwords support
PHP 7.4+ ✓        # Modern PHP features
SSL Certificate ✓  # Because security matters

# Your Machine
Python 3.8+ ✓     # For the MCP server
Claude Desktop ✓   # Your AI workspace
Coffee ☕         # Optional but recommended
```

#### Step 1: Clone This Beauty

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Breuk-AI/wordpress-mcp.git
cd wordpress-mcp

# Feel that? That's the power of open source in your terminal
```

#### Step 2: WordPress Plugin Installation

1. Navigate to `wp-mcp-plugin` folder
2. ZIP it up (or just drag the folder)
3. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/` 
4. Head to WordPress Admin → Plugins
5. Find "WordPress MCP Integration" 
6. Hit that Activate button with confidence

#### Step 3: Server Configuration

```bash
cd mcp-server
cp .env.example .env

# Now edit .env with your favorite editor
# Pro tip: Application Passwords look like: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
# Get yours from WordPress → Users → Your Profile → Application Passwords
```

#### Step 4: Claude Desktop Magic

Add this to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "wordpress": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["E:\\path\\to\\wordpress-mcp\\mcp-server\\server.py"],
    "env": {
      "WP_SITE_URL": "https://your-amazing-site.com",
      "WP_USERNAME": "your-username",
      "WP_APP_PASSWORD": "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎭 The Story Behind The Code

### July 2025: The Beginning

It started with a simple question: "Why can't Claude actually DO things in WordPress?"

After battling with existing solutions that were either too complex, too limited, or just didn't work the way we needed, we said those magic words that have started a thousand innovations:

**"Why NOT build our own?"**

### The Development Journey

- **Week 1:** Experiments, failures, coffee, breakthroughs
- **Week 2:** The MCP protocol finally clicked
- **Week 3:** Security hardening (because we're responsible)
- **Week 4:** That emotional moment seeing it work perfectly

### The First Public Commit (August 20, 2025)

```
🚀 feat: Initial release of WordPress MCP - Innovation meets collaboration

This isn't just code. It's the beginning of something special.
