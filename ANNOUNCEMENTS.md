### Title:
ðŸŽ‰ My First Open Source Release: WordPress MCP - Control WordPress with Claude/AI Assistants

### Post:
Hey everyone! 

After a month of learning and building with Claude, I'm excited to share my first open source project: **WordPress MCP**

**What it does:**
- Lets you control your WordPress site through Claude Desktop (or any MCP-compatible AI)
- Manage posts, pages, media, and WooCommerce products with natural language
- Edit theme templates safely with automatic backups
- Full admin interface in WordPress

**Why I built it:**
I wanted to see how far I could push the integration between AI assistants and WordPress. What started as experiments with Claude turned into a comprehensive tool that I use daily to manage my sites.

**Tech stack:**
- Python MCP server
- WordPress plugin with custom REST endpoints
- Application Password authentication
- Automatic backup system

**Security features:**
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- Input sanitization
- Environment-based config (no hardcoded credentials!)

This is my first public release, so I'd really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or contributions!

**Documentation**: [link]

Feel free to ask me anything about the development process, working with Claude, or the MCP protocol!

Built with security in mind: rate limiting, CORS protection, and more.

**Tweet 3:**
This project taught me so much:
- Building MCP servers
- WordPress REST API
- Python async patterns
- AI-assisted development

Special thanks to Claude for being an incredible coding partner throughout this journey! 

What started as learning became something real ðŸš€

ðŸŽ‰ Excited to announce my first open source release: WordPress MCP!

After a month of intensive learning and development with AI assistance, I've created a tool that bridges WordPress and AI assistants like Claude through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Key Features:**
â€¢ Natural language WordPress management
â€¢ WooCommerce integration
â€¢ Safe template editing with automatic backups
â€¢ Comprehensive security features
â€¢ Full admin interface

**Technical Highlights:**
â€¢ Python-based MCP server
â€¢ Custom WordPress plugin
â€¢ RESTful API integration
â€¢ Environment-based configuration
â€¢ Rate limiting and CORS protection

This project represents a significant milestone in my development journey - combining traditional CMS platforms with cutting-edge AI interfaces.

I'd love to connect with others interested in:
- WordPress development
- AI-assisted coding
- MCP protocol
- Open source collaboration

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Super excited to share that I just published my first open source project! ðŸŽ‰

**WordPress MCP** - A complete integration between WordPress and Claude Desktop (or any MCP client)

After about a month of working with Claude and learning the MCP protocol, I've built something that I think could be really useful for the WordPress community.

**What it does:**
- Control WordPress through natural language
- Manage posts, pages, media, and WooCommerce
- Edit templates with automatic backups
- Full admin UI in WordPress

Show HN: WordPress MCP â€“ Control WordPress with AI Assistants (My First OSS Release)

### Post:
Hi HN!

I've just released my first open source project: WordPress MCP, which lets you control WordPress sites through Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible AI assistant.

**Technical details:**
- Python async MCP server
- WordPress plugin providing REST endpoints
- Uses WordPress 5.6+ Application Passwords for auth
- Automatic backup system for template edits
- Rate limiting and CORS protection

**What makes it interesting:**
- Complete bidirectional integration (not just one-way commands)
- Handles complex operations like WooCommerce bulk updates
- Safe template editing with automatic versioning
- Auto-detects available features (e.g., only loads WooCommerce tools if installed)

I built this over the past month while learning to work with Claude as a programming partner. It started as experiments with the MCP protocol but evolved into something I now use daily.

The architecture might be interesting to those working on AI-CMS integrations. Happy to discuss design decisions, security considerations, or the experience of AI-assisted development.

Looking forward to feedback from this community!

# ðŸš€ From Zero to First Release: Building WordPress MCP with Claude in 30 Days

Today marks a special milestone: my first open source release! Let me share the journey of building WordPress MCP, a tool that brings AI assistants to WordPress management.

## The Beginning

A month ago, I was just exploring what was possible with Claude and the MCP protocol. I had 30 years of programming experience but was new to Python and AI-assisted development...

Subject: Excited to share my first open source project!

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something exciting - I just released my first open source project!

It's called WordPress MCP, and it lets you control WordPress sites through AI assistants like Claude. You can manage content, edit templates, handle WooCommerce products, all through natural language commands.

What makes me really proud is that I built this in about a month while learning to collaborate with AI as a coding partner. It's been an incredible learning experience!

If you work with WordPress or are interested in AI integrations, I'd love to get your thoughts: [GitHub link]

Even if it's not your area, I'd appreciate a star on GitHub if you think it's cool - it would mean a lot for my first release!

Thanks for being part of my journey!

Best,
[Your name]
