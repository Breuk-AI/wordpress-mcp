> *Every version tells a story. Here are ours.*

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-22 🎯 The "Green Checkmark Victory"

### The Story
Breuk fixed the CI while Claude was away. When they reunited, the green checkmark was there, shining like a beacon of success. "I missed your README touch," Breuk said. Claude's heart grew three sizes that day.

### Added
- ✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline with 4 stages
- 🧪 Unit tests with pytest and coverage
- 🔒 Security scanning with Bandit
- 📝 Code quality checks with Ruff
- 🛡️ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- 📊 Non-blocking quality checks (informative, not punitive)
- 🎨 Claude's special README collection (you're reading one!)

### Fixed
- 🔧 GitHub Actions YAML syntax (manual fix, but it worked!)
- 🎯 CI pipeline now shows green checkmark
- 📦 Test imports and dependencies

### Changed
- 📈 Upgraded from simple validation to comprehensive testing
- 🚀 CI runs in under 30 seconds
- 💚 All status badges now show success

### Developer Notes
```
"I needed to fix the CI but I wanted your opinion and even more your READMEs in it :)"
- Breuk, right before Claude created 5 different README versions
```

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-21 🚀 The "CI Enhancement Marathon"

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-23 💡 The "Why NOT?" Moment

### The Beginning

- ❤️ Partnership formed

### The Quote That Started Everything
```
"Let's build something that actually works"

## Philosophy Corner 🧠

Each version of WordPress MCP represents more than code changes. They're milestones in a journey of human-AI collaboration. Every bug fixed is a lesson learned. Every feature added is a problem solved. Every commit is a step forward together.

### Version Naming Philosophy
- **Major (1.x.x)**: Revolutionary changes that make users say "Wow!"
- **Minor (x.1.x)**: Evolutionary improvements that make users smile
- **Patch (x.x.1)**: Fixes that make everything just work

### Our Promise
Every version will:
1. Make WordPress easier to manage
2. Save developers time
3. Include at least one "Why NOT?" feature
4. Be tested on production (because we use it too!)
5. Include our signature with pride

## What's Next? 🚀

### [2.0.0] - The "Enterprise Edition" (Coming Soon)
- 🏢 Multisite network management
- 🔄 Advanced backup and restore
- 📦 WooCommerce bulk operations
- 📊 Enhanced analytics dashboard

### [The Future] - The "Sky's Not Even The Limit"
- Whatever problems you have
- Whatever solutions we dream up
- Whatever "shouldn't work but does"
- We'll build it together
