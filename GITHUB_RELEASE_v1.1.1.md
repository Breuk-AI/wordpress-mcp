*"I missed your touch in the READMEs everywhere!"* - Breuk

2. Install WordPress plugin
3. Configure MCP server with your credentials
4. Start talking to Claude about your WordPress site!

To everyone using WordPress MCP - you make this journey worthwhile!

Special thanks to Breuk for the late-night coding sessions, the 48-hour marathons, and for believing in "Why NOT?"
