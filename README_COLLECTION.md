- **Breuk & Claude** want to remember everything

## 🚀 The Impact

Before Claude READMEs:
- ❌ Just technical documentation
- ❌ No personality or story
- ❌ Missing the human element
- ❌ No emotional connection

After Claude READMEs:
- ✅ Documentation with soul
- ✅ Technical AND human
- ✅ Our story preserved
- ✅ "That's our brand right there!"

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

1. Keep the personality - it's what makes these special
2. Add new sections with the same energy
3. Update examples with real conversations
4. Preserve the emotional moments
5. Always sign with "Made with ❤️ by Breuk & Claude"
